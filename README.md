### Overview:

This was an assignment from Dr. Sangkil Moon's Consumer Analytics course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. The goal was to perform a conjoint analysis using SAS to assist with the development of a new product from a shoe manufacturer. Then, based on the findings from the conjoint analysis, compute the utility, and importance weights for each attribute. Finally, provide suggestions on what shoe design would be most profitable for the shoe manufacturer. 

### Tasks to be performed:

1. Using the data indicated (found in the .xlsx file), apply a conjoint regression and report the SAS result tables including the R-square and Parameter Estimates

2. Compute the part-worth (utility) for each of the 9 attribute levels. Only showing some major steps of your calculation process, but not all details

3. Compute the relative importance weights for the three-part worth values for all the 3 attributes

4. Complete the results table. Under an asumption that your client is the sneaker maker, provide your practical advice for your client.

*** Completed tasks are shown in the conjoint analysis output and findings word document (including calculations by hand)

### What is the importance of a conjoint analysis?

The conjoint analysis provides additional insights into consumer preferences. These additional insights can in turn allow a company to select various attributes when designing a new product that the majority of consumers favor increasing the likelihood of them purchasing that product. Furthermore, conjoint analysis can help with pricing as it can help with predicting the response from consumers over various pricing levels. By breaking the product design process into levels, and testing the different combinations, conjoint analysis can assist with selecting the optimal path to maximize profits.
